# 🚀 AI Upscaler Pro | Mike Robart Edition

A professional-grade image enhancement tool designed for high-performance resolution scaling. This application leverages advanced **Lanczos Resampling** and **Neural-Style Filters** to transform low-resolution images into high-definition assets.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
This project features a cutting-edge **Glassmorphism UI**, offering a seamless and futuristic user experience. It's not just about functionality; it's about aesthetic precision.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities
* **Intelligent Scaling:** Enhances images by 2x or 4x while preserving edge sharpness.
* **Advanced Filters:** Applies automated detail enhancement and contrast correction.
* **Vector Output:** Converts standard raster images into high-quality SVG wrappers for scalable usage.
* **Cloud-Optimized Architecture:** Specifically engineered to run in serverless environments like **Vercel**.

## 📂 Project Structure
As seen in the repository:
* `app.py`: The central AI processing engine.
* `templates/`: Contains the futuristic Glassmorphism frontend.
* `vercel.json`: Configuration for seamless cloud deployment.
* `requirements.txt`: Manages all Python dependencies (Flask, Pillow).
